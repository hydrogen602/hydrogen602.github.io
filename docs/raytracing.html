        <h3>Beginning of the project</h3>
        <p>
            The ray tracing projects started for me as a brief class assignment, 
            but then I continued experimenting with ray tracing even after 
            the completion of the assignment. After working on the project in Scala, 
            I attempted to write the code in C using pseudo object orientation 
            using structs and function pointers. I afterwards decided to return to 
            writing it with a procedural paradigm.

        <h3>Cython to connect C to Python</h3>
        <p>
            After figuring out the basics of the ray tracer in C, I discovered the usefulness of 
            Cython in its ability to connect C and Python together. The C code would be a module 
            that could be imported in Python and Python code would run it, but the heavy lifting 
            still happens in C. With this change I gained access to Python&apos;s vast collection of 
            libraries, and used one of them, pypng, to turn the result of the ray tracer in png images.
